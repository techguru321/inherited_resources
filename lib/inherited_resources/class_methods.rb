# = belongs to
#
# This allows you to specify to belongs_to in your controller. You might use
# this when you are having nested resources in your routes:
#
#   class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :project
#   end
#
# This will do all magic assuming some defaults. It assumes that your URL to
# access those tasks are:
#
#   /projects/:project_id/tasks
#
# But all defaults are configurable. The options are:
#
# * :parent_class => Allows you to specify what is the parent class.
#
#     belongs_to :project, :parent_class => AdminProject
#
# * :class_name => Also allows you to specify the parent class, but you should
#   give a string. Added for ActiveRecord belongs to compatibility.
#
# * :instance_name => How this object will appear in your views. In this case
#   the default is @project. Overwrite it with a symbol.
#
#     belongs_to :project, :instance_name => :my_project
#
# * :finder => Specifies which method should be called to instantiate the
#   parent. Let's suppose you are using slugs ("this-is-project-title") in URLs
#   so your tasks url would be: "projects/this-is-project-title/tasks". Then you
#   should do this in your TasksController:
#
#     belongs_to :project, :finder => :find_by_title!
#
#   This will make your projects be instantiated as:
#
#     Project.find_by_title!(params[:project_id])
#
#   Instead of:
#
#     Project.find(params[:project_id])
#
# * param => Allows you to specify params key used to instantiate the parent.
#   Default is :parent_id, which in this case is :project_id.
#
# * route_name => Allows you to specify what is the route name in your url
#   helper. By default is 'project'. But if your url helper should be
#   "admin_project_task_url" instead of "project_task_url", just do:
#
#     belongs_to :project, :route_name => "admin_project"
#
# = nested_belongs_to
#
# If for some reason you need to nested more than two resources, you can do:
#
#   class TasksController
#     belongs_to :company, :project
#   end
#
# ATTENTION! This DOES NOT mean polymorphic associations as in resource_controller.
# Polymorphic associations are not supported yet.
#
# It means that companies have many projects which have many tasks. You URL
# should be:
#
#   /companies/:company_id/projects/:project_id/tasks/:id
#
# Everything will be handled for you again. And all defaults will describe above
# will be assumed. But if you have to change the defaults. You will have to
# specify one association by one:
#
#   class TasksController
#     belongs_to :company, :finder => :find_by_name!, :param => :company_name
#     belongs_to :project
#   end
#
# belongs_to is aliased as nested_belongs_to, so this provides a nicer syntax:
#
#   class TasksController
#     nested_belongs_to :company, :finder => :find_by_name!, :param => :company_name
#     nested_belongs_to :project
#   end
#
# In this case the association chain would be:
#
#   Company.find_by_name!(params[:company_name]).projects.find(params[:project_id]).tasks.find(:all)
#
# When you are using nested resources, you have one more option to config.
# Let's suppose that to get all projects from a company, you have to do:
#
#   Company.admin_projects
#
# Instead of:
#
#   Company.projects
#
# In this case, you can set the collection_name in belongs_to:
#
#   nested_belongs_to :project, :collection_name => 'admin_projects'
#
# = polymorphic associations
#
# In some cases you have a resource that belongs to two different resources
# but not at the same time. For example, let's suppose you have File, Message
# and Task as resources and they are all commentable.
#
# Polymorphic associations allows you to create just one controller that will
# deal with each case.
#
#   class Comment < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#   end
#
# Your routes should be something like:
#
#   m.resources :files,    :has_many => :comments #=> /files/13/comments
#   m.resources :tasks,    :has_many => :comments #=> /tasks/17/comments
#   m.resources :messages, :has_many => :comments #=> /messages/11/comments
#
# When using polymorphic associations, you get some free helpers:
#
#   parent?         #=> true
#   parent_type     #=> :task
#   parent_class    #=> Task
#   parent          #=> @task
#
# This polymorphic controllers thing is a great idea by James Golick and he
# built it in resource_controller. Here is just a re-implementation.
#
# = optional polymorphic associations
#
# Let's take another break from ProjectsController. Let's suppose we are
# building a store, which sell products.
#
# On the website, we can show all products, but also products scoped to
# categories, brands, users. In this case case, the association is optional, and
# we deal with it in the following way:
#
#   class ProductsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :category, :brand, :user, :polymorphic => true, :optional => true
#   end
#
# This will handle all those urls properly:
#
#   /products/1
#   /categories/2/products/5
#   /brands/10/products/3
#   /user/13/products/11
#
# = nested polymorphic associations
#
# You can have polymorphic associations with nested resources. Let's suppose
# that our File, Task and Message resources in the previous example belongs to
# a project.
#
# This way we can have:
#
#   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :project {
#       belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#     }
#   end
#
# Or:
#
#   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     nested_belongs_to :project
#     nested_belongs_to :file, :message, :task, :polymorphic => true
#   end
#
# Choose the syntax that makes more sense to you. :)
#
# Finally your routes should be something like:
#
#   map.resources :projects do |m|
#     m.resources :files,    :has_many => :comments #=> /projects/1/files/13/comments
#     m.resources :tasks,    :has_many => :comments #=> /projects/1/tasks/17/comments
#     m.resources :messages, :has_many => :comments #=> /projects/1/messages/11/comments
#   end
#
# The helpers work in the same way as above.
#
# = singleton
#
# Singletons are usually used in associations which are related through has_one
# and belongs_to. You declare those associations like this:
#
#   class ManagersController < InheritedResources::Base
#     belongs_to :project, :singleton => true
#   end
#
# But in some cases, like an AccountsController, you have a singleton object
# that is not necessarily associated with another:
#
#   class AccountsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     defaults :singleton => true
#   end
#
# Besides that, you should overwrite the methods :resource and :build_resource
# to make it work properly:
#
#   class AccountsController < InheritedResources::Base
#     defaults :singleton => true
#
#     protected
#       def resource
#         @current_user.account
#       end
#
#       def build_resource(attributes = {})
#         Account.new(attributes)
#       end
#   end
#
# When you have a singleton controller, the action index is removed.
#
