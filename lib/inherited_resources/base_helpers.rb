      # If the user actually scopes the url, you should use belongs_to method

      # Helper to set flash messages. It's powered by I18n API.
      # It checks for messages in the following order:
      #
      #   flash.controller_name.action_name.status
      #   flash.actions.action_name.status
      #
      # If none is available, a default message is set. So, if you have
      # a CarsController, create action, it will check for:
      #
      #   flash.cars.create.status
      #   flash.actions.create.status
      #
      # The statuses can be :notice (when the object can be created, updated
      # or destroyed with success) or :error (when the objecy cannot be created
      # or updated).
      #
      # Those messages are interpolated by using the resource class human name.
      # This means you can set:
      #
      #   flash:
      #     actions:
      #       create:
      #         notice: "Hooray! {{resource_name}} was successfully created!"
      #
      # But sometimes, flash messages are not that simple. Going back
      # to cars example, you might want to say the brand of the car when it's
      # updated. Well, that's easy also:
      #
      #   flash:
      #     cars:
      #       update:
      #         notice: "Hooray! You just tuned your {{car_brand}}!"
      #
      # Since :car_name is not available for interpolation by default, you have
      # to overwrite interpolation_options.
      #
      #   def interpolation_options
      #     { :car_brand => @car.brand }
      #   end
      #
      # Then you will finally have:
      #
      #   'Hooray! You just tuned your Aston Martin!'
      #
      # If your controller is namespaced, for example Deluxe::CarsController, the
      # the messages will be checked in the following order:
      #
      #   flash.deluxe.cars.create.status
      #   flash.cars.create.status
      #   flash.actions.create.status
