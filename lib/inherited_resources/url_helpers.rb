          # Customization to allow polymorphic with singletons.
          #
          # Let's take the projects and companies where each one has one manager
          # example. The url helpers would be:
          #
          #   company_manager_url(@company)
          #   project_manager_url(@project)
          #
          # Notice how the manager is not sent in the helper, because it's a
          # singleton. So, polymorphic urls would be:
          #
          #   polymorphic_url(@company)
          #   polymorphic_url(@project)
          #
          # Obviously, this won't work properly. So in such cases, polymorphic
          # with singlestons we have to send this:
          #
          #   polymorphic_url(@company, 'manager')
          #   polymorphic_url(@project, 'manager')
          #
          # This is exactly what we are doing here.
          #
          # The other case to be handle, is collection and new helpers with
          # polymorphic urls.
          #
          # In such cases, we usually would not send anything:
          #
          #   project_tasks_url(@project)
          #   new_project_task_url(@project)
          #
          # But this wouldn't work with polymorphic urls by the same reason as
          # singletons:
          #
          #   polymorphic_url(@project)
          #   new_polymorphic_url(@project)
          #
          # So we have to do this:
          #
          #   polymorphic_url(@project, Task.new)
          #   new_polymorphic_url(@project, Task.new)
