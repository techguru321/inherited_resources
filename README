Description
-----------

Inherited Resources speeds up development by making your controllers inherit
all restful actions so you just have to focus on what is important. It makes
your controllers more powerful and cleaner at the same time.

Plus, making your controllers follow a pattern, it helps you to write better
code by following fat models and skinny controllers convention.

Inherited Resources is tested and compatible with Rails 2.2.2 and Rails 2.3.0.

keywords: resources, controller, singleton, belongs_to, polymorphic and I18n

Installation
------------

Install Inherited Resources is very easy. It is stored in GitHub, so just run
the following:

   gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
   sudo gem install josevalim-inherited_resources

If you want it as plugin, just do:

   script/plugin install git://github.com/josevalim/inherited_resources.git

Basic Usage
-----------

To use Inherited Resources you just have to inherit (duh) it:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
   end

And all actions are defined and working, check it! Your projects collection
(in the index action) is still available in the instance variable @projects
and your project resource (all other actions) is available as @ project.

The next step is to define which mime types this controller provides:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
   end

You can also specify them based per action:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     respond_to :html, :xml, :json
     respond_to :js, :only => :create
     respond_to :iphone, :except => [ :edit, :update ]
   end

Let's take a request on create with :rjs as example of how it works. After the
action is processed, it will check if the view "projects/create.js.rjs" exist.
If it does exist, it will render it, otherwise it will check if the resource
@project respond to :to_js. If it is true, it will render the result of :to_js,
otherwise it will render a 404.

Another option is to specify which actions the controller will inherit from
the InheritedResources::Base:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     actions :index, :show, :new, :create
   end

Or:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     actions :all, :except => [ :edit, :update, :destroy ]
   end

In your views, you will get the following helpers:

   resource        #=> @project
   collection      #=> @projects
   resource_class  #=> Project

As you might expect, collection (@projects instance variable) is only available
on index actions.

Overwriting defaults
--------------------

Now that you learned the default behavior and basic configuration, let's see
how to extend it.

Assuming that you have a PeopleController, but the resource is actually called
User, you could overwrite the resource name, collection name and instance name
just doing:

   class PeopleController < InheritedResources::Base
     defaults :resource_class => User, :collection_name => 'users', :instance_name => 'user'
   end

Further extensions is done by overwriting two methods. Let's suppose you want
to add pagination to your projects collection:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     protected
       def collection
         @projects ||= end_of_association_chain.paginate(params[:page]).all
       end
   end

In this case you could just have done:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     protected
       def collection
         @projects ||= Project.paginate(params[:page]).all
       end
   end

But you should get used if end_of_association_chain. When you have nested
resources it's very handy and it will deal with all nesting stuff. It was first
introduced in resource_controller by Jamis Golick and we will talk more about it
soon.

On the other hand, if you just added pretty urls for in your ProjectsController
(/projects/my-project-name), you can overwrite how projects are being found by:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     protected
       def resource
         @project ||= end_of_association_chain.find_by_title!(params[:title])
       end
   end

And now since you is acquainted to end_of_association_chain let's meet its
twin brother: begin_of_association_chain.

It's mostly used when you want to create resources based on the @current_user.
In such cases, you don't have your @current_user in the url, but in the session.

So if you have to do: @current_user.projects.find or @current_user.projects.build
you can deal with both just doing:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     protected
       def begin_of_association_chain
         @current_user
       end
   end

Overwriting actions
-------------------

Let's suppose that after destroying a project you want to redirect to your
root url instead of redirecting to projects url. You just have to do:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     def destroy
       super do |format|
         format.html { redirect_to root_url }
       end
     end
   end

You are opening your action and giving the parent action a new behavior. No
tricks, no DSL, just Ruby.

On the other hand, I have to agree that calling super is the right thing but
is not very readable. That's why all methods have aliases. So this is
equivalent:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     def destroy
       destroy! do |format|
         format.html { redirect_to projects_url }
       end
     end
   end

Now let's suppose that before create a project you have to do something special
but you don't want to create a before filter for it:

   class ProjectsController < InheritedResources::Base
     def create
       @project = Project.new(params[:project])
       @project.something_special!
       create!
     end
   end

Yeap, that simple! The nice part is since you already set the instance variable
@project, it will not do it again and overwrite your @project with something
special. :)

Flash messages and I18n
-----------------------

Flash messages are powered by I18n api. It checks for messages in the following
order:

   flash.controller_name.action_name.status
   flash.actions.action_name.status

If none is available, a default message in english set. Let's have a break from
projects and talk about CarsController. So in a create action, it will check for
flash messages in the following order:

   flash.cars.create.status
   flash.actions.create.status

The status can be :notice (when the object can be created, updated
or destroyed with success) or :error (when the objecy cannot be created
or updated).

Those messages are interpolated by using the resource class human name, which 
is also localized and it means you can set:

   flash:
     actions:
       create:
         notice: "Hooray! {{resource}} was successfully created!"

It will replace {{resource}} for Car properly.

But sometimes, flash messages are not that simple. Going back
to cars example, you might want to say the brand of the car when it's
updated. Well, that's easy also:

   flash:
     cars:
       update:
         notice: "Hooray! You just tuned your {{car_brand}}!"

Since :car_name is not available for interpolation by default, you have
to overwrite interpolation_options.

   def interpolation_options
     { :car_brand => @car.brand }
   end

Then you will finally have:

   'Hooray! You just tuned your Aston Martin!'

Belongs to
----------

Finally, our Projects are going to get some Tasks. Then you create a
TasksController and do:

   class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :project
   end

belongs_to accepts several options to be able to configure the association.
Remember that our projects have pretty urls? So if you thought that url like
/projects/:project_title/tasks would be a problem, I can assure you it won't:

   class TasksController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :project, :finder => :find_by_title!, :param => :project_title
   end

Check belongs_to file for more customization. :)

Nested belongs to
-----------------

Now, our Tasks get some Comments and you need to nest even deeper. Good
practices says that you should never nest more than two resources, but sometimes
you have to for security reasons. So this is an example of how you can do it:

   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
     nested_belongs_to :project, :task
   end

nested_belongs_to is actually just an alias to belongs_to created to make clear
what is happening. You can also declare nested_belongs_to like this:

   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :project do
       belongs_to :task
     end
   end

Polymorphic belongs to
----------------------

Now let's go even further. Our Projects is getting some Files and Messages
besides Tasks, and they are all commentable:

   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :task, :file, :message, :polymorphic => true
   end

You can even use it with nested resources:

   class CommentsController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :project do
       belongs_to :task, :file, :message, :polymorphic => true
     end
   end

When using polymorphic associations, you get some free helpers:

   parent?         #=> true
   parent_type     #=> :task
   parent_class    #=> Task
   parent          #=> @task

Polymorphic controller is another great idea by James Golick and he also uses
that on resource_controller.

Singletons
----------

Now we are going to add manager to projects. We say that Manager is a singleton
resource because a Project has just one manager. You should declare it as
has_one (or resource) in your routes.

To declare an association as singleton, you just have to give the :singleton
option.

   class ManagersController < InheritedResources::Base
     belongs_to :project, :singleton => true
   end

It will deal with everything again and hide the action :index from you.

URL Helpers
-----------

When you use InheritedResources it creates some URL helpers for you.
And they handle everything for you.

   # /posts/1/comments
   resource_url          # => /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}
   resource_url(comment) # => /posts/1/comments/#{comment.to_param}
   new_resource_url      # => /posts/1/comments/new
   edit_resource_url     # => /posts/1/comments/#{@comment.to_param}/edit
   collection_url        # => /posts/1/comments

   # /projects/1/tasks
   resource_url          # => /products/1/tasks/#{@task.to_param}
   resource_url(task)    # => /products/1/tasks/#{task.to_param}
   new_resource_url      # => /products/1/tasks/new
   edit_resource_url     # => /products/1/tasks/#{@task.to_param}/edit
   collection_url        # => /products/1/tasks
 
   # /users
   resource_url          # => /users/#{@user.to_param}
   resource_url(user)    # => /users/#{user.to_param}
   new_resource_url      # => /users/new
   edit_resource_url     # => /users/#{@user.to_param}/edit
   collection_url        # => /users

The nice thing is that those urls are not guessed during runtime. They are
all created when your application is loaded (except for polymorphic
associations, that relies on Rails polymorphic_url).

What's next
-----------

I'm working on generators and some nice things to speed up and make easier
your controllers tests with mocking and stubs. :)
